[00:02.71] Ah-ah-ha (supa dupa love)
[00:06.13] Supa dupa love
[00:11.35] Ha, uh-uh
[00:14.40] No, I ain't never felt a feeling like this
[00:16.62] Never had a feeling this big
[00:18.03] If I ever saw a sky full of shooting stars
[00:20.35] Then I'd be spending every single wish on you
[00:22.92] Nothing that I wouldn't do
[00:24.46] How'd you go and make a monster shy? It's true
[00:26.30] So different from the usual
[00:27.69] That every kinda beautiful
[00:29.05] My heart's running outta room
[00:30.48] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
[00:33.89] Gotta slow down, gotta cool down from you
[00:37.96] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
[00:41.24] I'm so all in, fireballing, I cannot lie
[00:45.64] Because of you, I'm flying high
[00:48.94] Because of you, I'm waking up in the sky
[00:52.44] Hand on my heart 'til death do us part
[00:56.28] The sweetest dynamite
[00:59.24] Boom, boom, boom
[01:00.81] I'm 'bout to explode
[01:02.67] How can I feel more than this? I don't know
[01:06.53] We got that supa dupa love, love, love
[01:11.12] Supa dupa love, love
[01:14.34] Boom, boom, boom
[01:15.86] My heart is too loud
[01:17.77] How can it get better than it is right now?
[01:21.59] We got that supa dupa love, love, love
[01:26.18] Supa dupa love, love, love
[01:30.62] This love is so gigantic, so galactic, massive, so enormous
[01:35.72] Just like magic, I've been seeing stars and hearing orchestras
[01:39.68] Like that zero gravity
[01:41.28] You and me beyond infinity
[01:42.90] Got me so up in the air like RUKA!
[01:45.00] Heart like a rocket, you're taking me there
[01:47.06] Houston, yeah we got a problem 'cause I lost control of emotion
[01:49.83] No hands on the wheel
[01:50.86] Needing more oxygen, you a phenomenon
[01:52.62] I could go on and on 'bout how I feel
[01:54.65] Can't stop, won't stop, I don't need a pit stop
[01:56.45] Beating like a boombox, no one got what you got
[01:58.28] Hitting me like a bazooka
[01:59.97] Only want love if it's supa dupa
[02:02.36] Because of you, I'm flying high
[02:05.77] Because of you, I'm waking up in the sky
[02:09.37] Hand on my heart 'til death do us part
[02:13.12] The sweetest dynamite
[02:15.92] Boom, boom, boom
[02:17.66] I'm 'bout to explode
[02:19.54] How can I feel more than this? I don't know
[02:23.38] We got that supa dupa love, love, love
[02:28.05] Supa dupa love, love
[02:31.20] Boom, boom, boom
[02:32.63] My heart is too loud
[02:34.68] How can it get better than it is right now?
[02:38.53] We got that supa dupa love, love, love
[02:43.29] Supa dupa love, love, love
