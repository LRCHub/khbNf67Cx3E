Bass up to the top
I like the beat, get ready to rock
When the bass goes to the boys
Supa-dupa-fly
Bring the bass up to the top
I like the beat, get ready to rock
When the bass goes to the boys
Supa-dupa-fly
Bring the bass up to the top
I like the beat, get ready to rock
When the bass goes to the boys
Back
Bass up to the top
I like the beat, get ready to rock
When the bass goes to the boys
Supa-dupa-fly
Bring the bass up to the top
I like the beat, get ready to rock
When the bass goes to the boys
Supa-dupa-fly
Bring the back
Supa-dupa-fly
Bring the bass up to the top
I like the beat, get ready to rock
When the bass goes to the boys
Supa-dupa-fly
Bring the bass up to the top
I like the beat, get ready to rock
When the bass goes to the boys
Supa-dupa-fly
Bring the bass up to the top
I like the beat, get ready to rock
When the bass goes to the boys
Supa-dupa-fly
Bring the bass up to the top
I like the beat, get ready to rock
When the bass goes to the boys
Supa-dupa-fly
Supa-dupa-fly
Bring the bass up to the top
I like the beat, get ready to rock
When the bass goes to the boys
Supa-dupa-fly
Supa-dupa-fly
