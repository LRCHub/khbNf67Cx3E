Ah, ah (Supa dupa love)
Supa dupa love
Ah, ah, ah
No, I ain't never felt a feeling like this
Never had a feeling this big
If I ever saw a sky full of shooting stars
Then I'd be spending every single wish on you
Nothing that I wouldn't do
How'd you go and make a monster shy? It's true
So different from the usual
That every kinda beautiful
My heart's running outta room
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Gotta slow down, gotta cool down from you
Woah, woah, woah, woah
I'm so all in, fireballin', I cannot lie
Because of you, I'm flying high
Because of you, I'm waking up in the sky
Hand on my heart 'til death do us part
The sweetest dynamite
Boom, boom, boom
I'm 'bout to explode
How can I feel more than this? I don't know
We got that supa dupa lovе, love, love
Supa dupa love, lovе
Boom, boom, boom
My heart is too loud
How can it get better than it is right now?
We got that supa dupa love, love, love
Supa dupa love, love
This love is so gigantic, so galactic, massive,
so enormous
Just like magic, I've been seeing stars and
hearing orchestras
Like that, zero gravity, you and me beyond
infinity
Got me so up in the air like RUKA
Heart like a rocket, you're taking me there
Houston, yeah, we got a problem
'Cause I lost control of emotion, no hands on
the wheel
Needing more oxygen, you a phenomenon
I could go on and on 'bout how I feel
Can't stop, won't stop, I don't need a pit stop
Beating like a boombox, no one got what you got
Hitting me like a bazooka
Only want love if it's supa dupa
Because of you, I'm flying high
Because of you, I'm waking up in the sky
Hand on my heart till death do us part
The sweetest dynamite
Boom, boom, boom
I'm 'bout to explode
How can I feel more than this? I don't know
We got that supa dupa love, love, love
Supa dupa love, love
Boom, boom, boom
My heart is too loud
How can it get better than it is right now?
We got that supa dupa love, love, love
Supa dupa love, love, love
